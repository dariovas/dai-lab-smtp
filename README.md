# DAI lab: SMTP
***

## Description
The goal of this repo is from a file containing messages and a file containing victim emails to send prank emails to victims.

if people exploring GitHub find your repo, without a prior knowledge of the API course, they should be able to understand what your repo is all about and whether they should look at it more closely.

## Mock server setup
To setup the mock server used by this client.

Instructions for setting up your mock SMTP server. The user who wants to experiment with your tool but does not really want to send pranks immediately should be able to use a mock SMTP server.

## Tool configuration and usage
Clear and simple instructions for configuring your tool and running a prank campaign. If you do a good job, an external user should be able to clone your repo, edit a couple of files and send a batch of e-mails in less than 10 minutes.

## Technical details
document the key aspects of your code. It is a good idea to start with a class diagram. Decide which classes you want to show (focus on the important ones) and describe their responsibilities in text. It is also certainly a good idea to include examples of dialogues between your client and an SMTP server (maybe you also want to include some screenshots here).
