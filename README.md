# DAI lab: SMTP
***

## Description

In this GitHub you will find a program for sending mail.

Emails are sent using the SMTP protocol.
We have a list of victims.
A mail is sent to a group.
The first victim in a group is the sender, the others are the recipients.

To use this code, you need an SMTP server.
You can find [here](#mock-server-setup) how to set up a local SMTP Server.

Prerequisites : docker, maven and java.

## Mock server setup
For using this code you need an SMTP server.

In this project we use a docker image name [maildev](https://github.com/maildev/maildev)

To run / download the image you need to run this command.
``` 
docker run -p 1080:1080 -p 1025:1025 maildev/maildev
```

To connect to the web interface you need to use this URL :
```
http://localhost:1080
```

To connect to the SMTP server you need to use the **1025** port.

## Tool configuration and usage
### Configure recipients and senders
To configure the recipients and the senders, you need to fill in a JSON file as shown in the example below :
```
  {
    "email": "test@hotmail.com"
  }
```
### Configure the prank mail contents
To configure the prank mail contents, you need to fill in a JSON file as shown in the example below :
```
  {
    "subject": "Test subject",
    "body": "Test body."
  }
```
Our json files are located [here](src/main/java/ch/heig/dai/lab/smtp/data)

### Tool configuration 
Firstly, you need to package the application with maven :
```
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```

Then, you can run it with this command :
```
java -jar ./target/dai-lab-smtp-1.0.jar <arguments>
```

The arguments are listed below :
- "-g"            --> number of groups (***mandatory***)
- "-v"            --> path to the victim.json file (***mandatory***)
- "-m"            --> path to the message.json file (***mandatory***)
- "--server-host" --> server SMTP IP (not mandatory, by default : localhost)
- "--server-port" --> server Port (not mandatory, by default : 25)

Full example :
```
java -jar ./target/dai-lab-smtp-1.0.jar -g 3 -v ./src/main/java/ch/heig/dai/lab/smtp/data/victim.json -m ./src/main/java/ch/heig/dai/lab/smtp/data/message.json --server-port 1025
```

## Technical details
In this application, we use these specific libraries :
- jackson-databind --> to read the JSON file
- logback-classic --> simple logging facade for Java applications
- lombok --> to auto generate the getter and setter and also the logger in our classes.
- jcommander --> to parse the CLI arguments

### Class diagram
![diagram.png](img%2Fdiagram.png)
We use the JSON Reader class to read user-supplied json configuration files.

The group class allows us to have separate groups. Inside, we have the sender and the receivers. The latter is used to create messages and the list of receivers.
The main PrankManager class manages the reading of JSON files, groups and the SMTP client. 
We also store the list of all messages and victims contained in the JSON files.

### Client dialog
![smtp_communication.png](img%2Fsmtp_communication.png)
You can see above all the requests sent to the SMTP server from our client and the server's responses.

#### It works as follows :

The customer announces himself (HELO)

specifies the sender (MAIL FROM: )

it specifies the receivers (RCP TO : )

It gives the mail data (DATA) such as sender (From), receivers (To), date (Date), subject (Subject) and mail body.
Say it's the end (<CR><LF>.<CR><LF>)

And exit the connection. (Quit)

The data following DATA (From, To, Date,...) are for display only - the real sender and receivers are specified above(MAIL FROM: , RCPT TO:).
